# File-based-key-value-data-store-with-basic-CRD
File-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, and delete) operations. This data store is meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop. The data store will be exposed as a library to clients and that can instantiate a class and can work with data store.
